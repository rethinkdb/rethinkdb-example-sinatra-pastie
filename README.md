# What is it #

A simple [Pastie.org](http://pastie.org)-like web application inspired by Nick Plante's [toopaste](https://github.com/zapnap/toopaste) project
showing how to use **RethinkDB as a backend for Sinatra applications**.

The app demos the following functionality:

*   Creating a new snippet (code highlighting included)
*   Retrieving a snippet
*   Listing snippets for a language

The app could be easily extended to provide more interesting features like:

*   pagination
*   snippet expiration

Fork it and send us a pull request.
